Lab Questions
=======================
1. The output you get from running f[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9] is: val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10] : int list.

2. The function f takes in an int list and in each element of the list, adds 1 to it and changes the element to the new number.

3. From line 12 of the code: (*Bind x to the head of the int list, and xs to the tail. Then, add one to the head and recursively call the function on the tail.*)

4. From line 13 of the code: (*Define the function. The function will take in an int list and output a different int list*)

5. False. Logically, it should be false, as the function is looking for a string of "one" but that isn't the same as the string "1". Logically, this is the correct output.

6. This isMember function uses tail recursion.

7. The output for the call is { it was the best of times, it was the worst of times }.

8. Tail recursion allows for optimizations to be made that normally can't be made. This is because the recursive call is the very last thing that is executed.

9. The output I get is { green eggs and ham }.

10. The output I get is { and macaroni macaroni and cheese }

11. I like that some of the potentially more complex functions in ML are made simpler using patterns. I feel that had we been in another language, the Union and Intersect functions would have been very messy and not as nice to look at.

12. I dislike the majority of the language as a whole. It felt like reading code was more complex and difficult. If I didn't give the code my undivided attention, I would lose where I was and my understanding of the code would go out the window and I would have to start over again.

13. I kind of enjoyed the lab. It really made me have to think about the syntax of the language. The challenge of this I enjoyed. However, the frustration I got from trying to understand the syntax was also unfun.

14. 11 hours between thinking about concepts and actual coding/debugging.

15. I personally don't ever plan on using ML again in the future. The only time I would use it again would be for another class or for employment purposes.
