Lab Questions
=======================
1. The output you get from running f[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9] is: val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10] : int list.

2. The function f takes in an int list and in each element of the list, adds 1 to it and changes the element to the new number.

3. From line 12 of the code: (*Bind x to the head of the int list, and xs to the tail. Then, add one to the head and recursively call the function on the tail.*)

4. From line 13 of the code: (*Define the function. The function will take in an int list and output a different int list*)
